Off-Canvas Mobile Nav
========================

A responsive design navigation pattern with CSS3 animation
----------------------------------------------------------

This is a CSS-based mobile navigation which slides out from off-canvas using CSS3 keyframe animation. The style is applied for smaller screens only with the use of media queries.

The CSS is compiled from SASS, with a dependency on the [Bourbon mixin library](http://bourbon.io/) to make the animation syntax much easier.
